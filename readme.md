<h1>Installation of Various plugins</h1><br/>

 <p> Install the various kinds of plugins that wish to use searching from plugin repository. List of plugins can be found here. http://gulpjs.com/plugins/ </p><br/>


<strong>2. Install the plugins by running following command</strong><br/>
			
		-> npm install plugin-name --save-dev
		-> eg: npm install gulp-uglify gulp-rename  --save-dev

		(use root access if you get error)

		This will add the dependencies code in package.json file. You can add,modify, or delete the plugins from there too.

<strong>use the various plugins like I have used in gulpfile.js file</strong><br/>
